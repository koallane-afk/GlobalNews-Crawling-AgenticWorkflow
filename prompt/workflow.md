# GlobalNews Agentic Workflow — Auto-Build System

Build a fully operational news crawling + big data analysis system that automatically collects articles from 44 news sites worldwide, analyzes them with 56 techniques, and classifies signals into a 5-Layer hierarchy (Fad → Short → Mid → Long → Singularity).

## Overview

- **Input**: PRD (`coding-resource/PRD.md`) + 44 news site URLs + user requirements
- **Output**: Fully operational Python-based news crawling + analysis system with cron automation
- **Frequency**: One-time build (the built system then runs daily via cron)
- **Autopilot**: disabled
- **pACS**: enabled

**Absolute Objective**: Build a news crawling service **automatically** via an AI agentic workflow automation system. Every step, every agent, every line of code serves this singular purpose: a system that crawls 44 news sites, extracts title/date/body/source URL without exception (these mandatory fields enable users to perform diverse Q&A queries on the crawled data for additional insights), collects **ALL news published within 24 hours with zero omissions**, and **never gives up until the mission is complete — 무한 반복**. The 4-level retry system (NetworkGuard 5 × Standard+TotalWar 2 × Crawler 3 × Pipeline 3 = 90 automated attempts) provides near-infinite persistence; after exhausting all 90 automated attempts, Tier 6 escalates to Claude Code interactive analysis for manual breakthrough — the pipeline does not terminate, it escalates. Self-modifies its own Python code in real-time when blocked.

**Hard Constraints** (from PRD):
- **C1 — Claude API = $0**: Claude API is NEVER called. ALL analysis (NLP, time series, network, signal classification) runs on local Python libraries only. Claude Code subscription covers orchestration only.
- **C2 — Conductor Pattern**: Claude Code generates Python scripts → executes via Bash → reads results → decides next step. It never processes data directly.
- **C3 — MacBook M2 Pro 16GB**: Entire pipeline runs on a single machine. No cloud GPU.
- **C4 — Output = Parquet/SQLite**: No dashboards, no reports, no visualization. Structured data only.
- **C5 — Legal Crawling**: robots.txt respected, rate limiting enforced, no personal data collected.

**Target Sites (44)**:

## Inherited DNA (Parent Genome)

> This workflow inherits the complete genome of AgenticWorkflow.
> Purpose varies by domain; the genome is identical. See `soul.md §0`.

**Constitutional Principles** (adapted to this workflow's domain):

1. **Quality Absolutism** — The ONLY metric is whether the built system successfully crawls all 44 sites and produces accurate analysis. Speed, token cost, and effort are irrelevant. A crawling failure on even one site is a quality failure.
2. **Single-File SOT** — `.claude/state.yaml` holds all shared state. Only Orchestrator/Team Lead writes. All agents read-only.
3. **Code Change Protocol** — Every Python script modification follows Intent → Ripple Analysis → Change Plan. Coding Anchor Points (CAP-1~4): think before coding, simplicity first, goal-driven execution, surgical changes.

**Inherited Patterns**:

| DNA Component | Inherited Form |
|--------------|---------------|
| 3-Phase Structure | Research → Planning → Implementation |
| SOT Pattern | `.claude/state.yaml` — single writer (Orchestrator/Team Lead) |
| 4-Layer QA | L0 Anti-Skip → L1 Verification → L1.5 pACS → L2 Adversarial Review |
| P1 Hallucination Prevention | Deterministic validation scripts (`validate_*.py`) |
| P2 Expert Delegation | Specialized sub-agents: crawling, anti-block, NLP, time series, integration |
| Safety Hooks | `block_destructive_commands.py` — dangerous command blocking |
| Adversarial Review | `@reviewer` — final code quality + security review |
| Decision Log | `autopilot-logs/` — transparent decision tracking |
| Context Preservation | Snapshot + Knowledge Archive + RLM restoration |

**Domain-Specific Gene Expression**:
- **P1 (Data Refinement)** genes are STRONGLY expressed — crawled HTML → Python extraction → clean text → AI analysis. Every data handoff has explicit pre/post-processing.
- **P2 (Expert Delegation)** genes are STRONGLY expressed — crawling specialists, NLP specialists, time series specialists each operate in isolated expert contexts.
- **CCP (Code Change Protocol)** genes are STRONGLY expressed — this workflow PRODUCES code. Every script must follow CCP rigorously.
- **Never Give Up (D2)** gene is uniquely expressed — 3-tier retry system, 6-tier escalation, self-modifying code. This gene has no equivalent in the parent genome; it is a domain-specific mutation.

## Research

### 1. Target Site Reconnaissance & Classification
- **Pre-processing**: `python3 scripts/extract_site_urls.py` — Parse the 44 URLs from `sources.yaml`, output structured site list with domain, expected language, and group classification
- **Agent**: `@site-recon` (sonnet)
- **Verification**:
  - [ ] All 44 sites visited and analyzed (zero omissions)
  - [ ] Each site entry contains: RSS availability (Y/N + URL), sitemap availability (Y/N + URL), dynamic loading detection (Y/N), paywall detection (Y/N), bot-blocking level (none/low/medium/high/extreme), primary language, section count estimate
  - [ ] Sites classified into crawling difficulty tiers: Easy (RSS+sitemap), Medium (DOM navigation), Hard (dynamic+anti-bot), Extreme (paywall+fingerprint)
  - [ ] Output format compatible with Step 5 architecture design (structured YAML/JSON)
- **Task**: Visit each of the 44 target news sites. For each site: (1) Check robots.txt and extract Crawl-delay, Disallow paths. (2) Probe for sitemap.xml and RSS feeds. (3) Analyze homepage structure — static HTML vs JavaScript-rendered, infinite scroll, load-more buttons. (4) Test basic HTTP request with standard UA to detect immediate blocking. (5) Classify difficulty tier. (6) Record mandatory field extraction feasibility: title (`<h1>`, `og:title`), published_at (`article:published_time`), body (article content area), source URL. Reference: PRD §5.1.1 Dynamic-First, §4.3 3-Tier URL Discovery, §4.4 Legal Framework.

### 10. (team) Crawling Core Engine Implementation
- **Team**: `crawl-engine-team`
- **Checkpoint Pattern**: dense
- **Pre-processing**: `python3 scripts/extract_architecture_crawling.py` — Filter Step 5 architecture blueprint to crawling layer specs + Step 6 strategy summary
- **Tasks**:
  - `@crawler-core-dev` (opus): Implement the core crawling engine: `src/crawling/crawler.py`. (1) NetworkGuard class with 5-retry exponential backoff per HTTP request (base=2s, max=30s, jitter). (2) 3-Tier URL Discovery: Tier 1 (RSS/Sitemap parser — feedparser + lxml), Tier 2 (DOM navigation — beautifulsoup4 + httpx), Tier 3 (Playwright/Patchright dynamic rendering). (3) Article extraction chain: Fundus → Trafilatura → Newspaper4k fallback. (4) Mandatory field extraction with validation: title, published_at, body, url — raise error if any missing (these fields are mandatory because users perform diverse Q&A queries on the crawled data for additional insights; incomplete records break downstream querying). (5) JSONL output writer with atomic file operations. (6) Per-site config loading from `sources.yaml`. (7) Rate limiter respecting per-site `rate_limit_seconds`. (8) Crawl state persistence (resume from last successful URL on restart). Reference: PRD §5.1.1, Step 5 architecture, Step 6 strategies.
    - **Checkpoints** (dense):
      - CP-1: NetworkGuard + HTTP client architecture → report to Team Lead
      - CP-2: 3-Tier URL Discovery + Article extraction chain → report
      - CP-3: Complete crawler with JSONL output + tests → final report + pACS
    - Output: `src/crawling/crawler.py`, `src/crawling/network_guard.py`, `src/crawling/url_discovery.py`, `src/crawling/article_extractor.py`
  - `@anti-block-dev` (opus): Implement the adaptive anti-block system: `src/crawling/anti_block.py`. (1) BlockDetector class — diagnose 7 block types (IP block, UA filter, rate limit, CAPTCHA, JS challenge, fingerprint, geo-block) from HTTP responses. (2) 6-Tier escalation engine: Tier 1 (delay adjustment 5→10→15s + UA rotation), Tier 2 (session/cookie cycling + Referer + header diversification), Tier 3 (Playwright/Patchright headless rendering), Tier 4 (Patchright + fingerprint-suite), Tier 5 (proxy rotation — configurable provider), Tier 6 (failure logging for Claude Code interactive analysis). (3) Circuit Breaker pattern: Closed→Open(5 consecutive failures, 30min wait)→Half-Open(single test). (4) **"Total War" mode**: `pip3 install undetected-chromedriver` then deploy undetected-chromedriver for paywall/extreme sites (nytimes, ft, wsj, bloomberg, hankyung) — this is the named escalation beyond standard Playwright. (5) Self-modifying strategy: when a tier fails, automatically escalate and log the failure pattern for future avoidance. (6) Strategy persistence: save successful strategies per-site to `data/config/site_profiles.json` for reuse. Reference: PRD §5.1.2, user requirement for self-modifying code.
    - **Checkpoints** (dense):
      - CP-1: BlockDetector 7-type diagnosis → report
      - CP-2: 6-Tier escalation + Circuit Breaker → report
      - CP-3: Complete anti-block with undetected-chromedriver + strategy persistence → final report + pACS
    - Output: `src/crawling/anti_block.py`, `src/crawling/block_detector.py`, `src/crawling/circuit_breaker.py`, `src/crawling/stealth_browser.py`
  - `@dedup-dev` (sonnet): Implement the deduplication engine: `src/crawling/dedup.py`. (1) URL normalizer — remove query params (utm_*, ref, etc.), normalize protocol/trailing slashes. (2) Content hash — SimHash for body text (95%+ similarity = duplicate). (3) Title similarity — Jaccard coefficient + Levenshtein edit distance for cross-outlet same-story detection. (4) Dedup database — SQLite-backed seen-URLs + content-hashes for persistence across runs. (5) Filter interface: `is_duplicate(url, title, body) → bool`. When duplicate detected, skip all extraction (title, date, body, URL not collected per user requirement). Reference: PRD §5.1.3, user requirement for dedup filtering.
    - Output: `src/crawling/dedup.py`, `src/crawling/url_normalizer.py`
  - `@ua-rotation-dev` (sonnet): Implement User-Agent rotation and session management: `src/crawling/ua_manager.py`. (1) UA pool with ≥ 50 real browser User-Agents (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge — desktop + mobile variants, latest versions). (2) Weighted rotation — distribute UAs to simulate natural browser distribution. (3) Session manager — cookie jar per UA, session lifecycle (create, use N requests, retire). (4) Referer chain builder — generate realistic referer headers (Google Search → site homepage → section → article). (5) Header diversification — Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, Connection headers matching UA browser type. (6) Integration interface for NetworkGuard: `get_request_headers(site_url) → dict`. Reference: User requirement for UA rotation to avoid bot classification.
    - Output: `src/crawling/ua_manager.py`, `src/crawling/session_manager.py`
- **Join**: All teammates complete → Team Lead verifies module interfaces are compatible → integration test

### 12. Crawling Pipeline Integration & 3-Tier Retry System
- **Pre-processing**: Verify Steps 10 and 11 outputs exist and pass basic import test
- **Agent**: `@integration-engineer` (opus)
- **Verification**:
  - [ ] `src/crawling/pipeline.py` orchestrates: load sources.yaml → iterate sites → adapter selection → URL discovery → article extraction → dedup → JSONL output
  - [ ] 4-level retry system implemented: NetworkGuard(5) × Standard+TotalWar escalation(2) × Crawler round(3) × Pipeline restart(3) = 90 automated attempts — near-infinite persistence ("임무 완수까지 무한 반복에 가까운 집요함"). After 90 automated retries exhausted, Tier 6 escalates to Claude Code interactive analysis (never silently terminates)
  - [ ] All crawled articles written to single consolidated JSONL file: `data/raw/YYYY-MM-DD/all_articles.jsonl` (user requirement: single file for downstream task reuse — the next workflow stage consumes this file directly)
  - [ ] Each JSONL record contains mandatory fields: title, published_at, body, source_url, source_name, language, crawled_at, content_hash (title/date/body/url are mandatory because users perform diverse Q&A queries on crawled data for additional insights)
  - [ ] URL dedup prevents re-collection on pipeline restart (already-collected URLs skipped)
  - [ ] Pipeline produces structured crawl report: per-site success/fail counts, total articles, blocked sites, time elapsed
  - [ ] End-to-end test: pipeline crawls ≥ 3 articles from at least 5 diverse sites (1 Korean, 1 English, 1 paywall, 1 multilingual, 1 with anti-bot)
  - [ ] `python3 main.py crawl --date today` executes full pipeline without unhandled errors
- **Task**: Integrate all crawling components into a unified pipeline. (1) Create `src/crawling/pipeline.py` — the main orchestrator that: loads `sources.yaml`, iterates through enabled sites, selects appropriate adapter, runs 3-Tier URL discovery, extracts articles, applies dedup filter, writes to consolidated JSONL. (2) Implement 3-tier retry architecture: Level 1 (NetworkGuard — 5 retries per HTTP request), Level 2 (Crawler — 3 rounds per site with increasing delays), Level 3 (Pipeline — 3 full restarts preserving already-collected URLs via dedup). Between standard attempts and retries, escalate anti-block tier (Standard → TotalWar with undetected-chromedriver). Total: 5 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 90 automated attempts per article — near-infinite persistence ("임무 완수까지 무한 반복"). After 90 automated retries exhausted, Tier 6 escalates to Claude Code interactive analysis for manual breakthrough (the pipeline never silently gives up). "Total War" mode activates when standard retries fail: `pip3 install undetected-chromedriver` → deploy for paywall/extreme sites. (3) Consolidate all articles into single JSONL file per day (single file for downstream task reuse). (4) Generate crawl statistics report. (5) Implement graceful shutdown with checkpoint saving. Reference: User requirements for 4-level retry, single file output, mission-complete persistence, user Q&A on crawled data.

### SOT (State Management)

- **SOT File**: `.claude/state.yaml`
- **Write Permission**: Orchestrator (main session) or Team Lead (during team steps) — single writer
- **Agent Access**: Read-only — all agents read SOT but never write; they produce output files only
- **Quality Override**: Team members MAY read each other's output files directly when cross-referencing improves quality (e.g., adapter developers reading core engine interfaces). SOT single-write point is always preserved.

### Context Injection Pattern

**Pattern B — Filtered Delegation** (PRD = ~30,000 tokens, 50-200KB range)

PRD를 에이전트에 전달할 때 전체를 넘기지 않고, Python 전처리 스크립트로 관련 섹션만 필터링하여 주입한다.

```yaml
context_injection:
  pattern: "B — Filtered Delegation"
  source: "coding-resource/PRD.md"
  source_size: "~30,000 tokens"
  filter_scripts:
    step-1:  "scripts/extract_site_urls.py"            # §4.3, §5.1.1 → site-recon
    step-3:  "scripts/merge_recon_and_deps.py"          # Step 1 + Step 2 → crawl-analyst
    step-5:  "scripts/filter_prd_architecture.py"       # §6, §7, §8 → system-architect
    step-6:  "scripts/split_sites_by_group.py"          # Step 1 data + group split → crawl-strategists
    step-7:  "scripts/filter_prd_analysis.py"           # §5.2 → pipeline-designer
    step-13: "scripts/extract_pipeline_design_s1_s4.py" # Step 7 Stages 1-4 → analysis-foundation-team
    step-14: "scripts/extract_pipeline_design_s5_s8.py" # Step 7 Stages 5-8 → analysis-signal-team
  rule: "Each Pre-processing script extracts ONLY the sections relevant to that agent's task. Never pass full PRD to a sub-agent."
